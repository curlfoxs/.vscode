- [Removed spaces from snippet prefixes](https://github.com/waldo1001/crs-al-language-extension/issues/121), which makes it behave much better in IntelliSense.

## [1.1.7] - 2019-06-06
- [Kenneth Fuglsang](https://github.com/kfuglsang) changed the field-handling: [only add quotes when necessary](https://github.com/waldo1001/crs-al-language-extension/pull/120).  Thanks so much!

## [1.1.6] - 2019-05-28
Fixed:
- [Rename command adds quotes around all object + control names](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/114) by [rvanbekkum](https://github.com/rvanbekkum) - thanks so much!
- Improved stability for "rename with Git" (remember the setting `crs.RenameWithGit`)
- snippet - [tfield does not show DateTime as you time](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/116) - reported by [GreatScott000](https://github.com/GreatScott000)
- vulnerability issue with typescript

## [1.1.3] - 2019-04-12
Improved snippets, including a contribution of [Rasmus Aaen](https://github.com/RasmusTidselbak) with a snippet for test cases by [this pullrequest](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/pull/113).

## [1.1.2] - 2019-03-28
Fixed:
- [CRS: Reorganize - All Files error](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/110)

## [1.1.0] - 2019-03-26
New: 
- [Run Current object from Status Bar / Right click](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/107)
- New Output channel for this extension: all actions are logged there!

Improved:
- Renaming/Reorganizing using `git mv`, as requested by [Chris Blank](https://github.com/ChrisBlankDe) [here](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/100).  Enable by setting this setting:
    * `RenameWithGit`: Use 'git mv' to rename a file.  This keeps history of the file, but stages the rename, which you should commit separately.  **The feature is still in preview-mode, therefore the default value is 'false'**
- [Add Prefix/Suffix to pageextension Groups and Fields](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/93)
- Significantly less [Debug Console Messages](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/106)
- Snippets thanks to [Chris Blank](https://github.com/ChrisBlankDe)!

- Fixed - Issue with situations when many comments are in a file, which could cause (by exception) taking the wrong text for determining the object properties.  Filed by [Luc van Vugt](https://github.com/lvanvugt) in [this issue](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/99).

## [0.2.22] - 2018-07-06
Fixed unreadable documentation - basically nothing changed

## [0.2.20] - 2018-07-06
- New Feature: automatic object name for Extension Objects with a new setting:
    * `CRS.ExtensionObjectNamePattern`: The pattern for the object name. If set (it's not set by default), it will perform an automatic object name for extension objects
        - `<Prefix>`
        - `<Suffix>`Âµ
        - `<ObjectType>`
        - `<ObjectTypeShort>` - a short notation of the object type.
        - `<ObjectTypeShortUpper>` - Same as "ObjectTypeShort" but uppercased
        - `<ObjectId>`
        - `<BaseName>` - weird chars are removed - does NOT include prefix nor suffix
        - `<BaseNameShort>` - does NOT include prefix nor suffix
        - `<BaseId>` - If you want this to work, you need to put the Id in comment after the base name (see below)

## [0.2.19] - 2018-07-03
- Fixed prefix and suffix behaviour:
    * Now also suffixes on fields and actions
    * No suffix/prefix anymore on action of new pages
- Fixed setting "CRS.AlSubFolderName" - changed "Src" to "src", as that is Microsoft's recommendation ([pullrequest](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/pull/63) from [spookymattress](https://github.com/spookymattress) :-)).
- Added functionality: **Search on Google / Microsoft Docs** - these two commands have been added to search for any given search string on Google or Microsoft Docs: 
    * CRS: Search Microsoft Docs
    * CRS: Search Google

    The selected word in the editor will be added by default as a search string and the search string "Business Central" will automatically be added.

## [0.2.18] - 2018-07-02
- No bugfixes (none reported)
- Improved efficiency of many existing snippets
- Added snippets for "fieldgroups" (like Brick and DropDown)

## [0.2.17] - 2018-06-24
Two new settings by [pullrequest](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/pull/56) from [Johannes Wikman](https://github.com/jwikman):
- `CRS.RemovePrefixFromFilename`: When using the Reorganize/Rename-commands, this setting will remove any prefix from the filename (but keep it in object name).  Tip: use as a workspace-setting
- `CRS.RemoveSuffixFromFilename`: When using the Reorganize/Rename-commands, this setting will remove any suffix from the filename (but keep it in object name).  Tip: use as a workspace-setting

## [0.2.16] - 2018-06-21
- This [pullrequest](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/pull/53) that was created by [Johannes Wikman](https://github.com/jwikman) solved a problem with weird characters in the objects names.
- The pullrequest above also also solved this [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/54), by [Mohana Yadav](https://github.com/pmohanakrishna).

## [0.2.15] - 2018-06-13
- Solved [Github Issue](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/48) and in the meanwhile, I have been refactoring and extending the "Rename FileName" functionality a bit, resulting in these tags (copy from ReadMe.md):
    - `<Prefix>` - just the prefix separately
    - `<Suffix>` - just the suffix separately
    - `<ObjectType>`
    - `<ObjectTypeShort>` - a short notation of the object type.
    - `<ObjectTypeShortUpper>` - Same as "ObjectTypeShort" but uppercased
    - `<ObjectId>`
    - `<ObjectName>` - weird chars are removed - includes prefix and suffix
    - `<ObjectNameShort>`    
    - `<BaseName>` - weird chars are removed - does NOT include prefix nor suffix
    - `<BaseNameShort>` - does NOT include prefix nor suffix
    - `<BaseId>` - If you want this to work, you need to put the Id in comment after the base name

- Solved [Github Issue](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/47) - renaming with prefix messed up the format of the fields
- Solved [Github Issue](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/44) - ability to override the launch.json with a PublicWebBaseUrl

- Minor changes to some existing snippets

## [0.2.9] - 2018-05-23
Configurations:
- `CRS.AlSubFolderName`: Added "Src" and "Source" folder (which Microsoft uses internally).  Remember: 'None' prevents the 'Reorganize' to do anything (if you want to apply your own folder structure)
- `CRS.DisableDefaultAlSnippets` is not by default "true" anymore as I decided that disabling the default AL snippets should be a conscious decision.

## [0.2.8] - 2018-05-16
Added following snippets:
- tmynotifications - apply "discover event subscriber" for adding a "My Notification"
- tassistedsetup - apply "discover event subscriber" for adding an assisted setup

- Minor bugfixes

## [0.2.4] - 2018-04-29
New command - Run CAL Test Tool in Web Client
## [0.2.3] - 2018-04-25
Small bugfix - [Github](https://github.com/CloudReadySoftware/crs-al-language-extension/issues/21)
## [0.2.2] - 2018-04-25
Improved some snippets.

Added 2 new settings to control "prefix" and "suffix" of object names and filenames:
* `CRS.ObjectNamePrefix`: When using the Reorganize/Rename-commands, this setting will make sure the object name (and filename) will have a Prefix.
* `CRS.ObjectNameSuffix`: When using the Reorganize/Rename-commands, this setting will make sure the object name (and filename) will have a Suffix.

Added an ability to rename/reorganize when you save a document.  This way, your commit to SCM will always to be correct:
* `CRS.OnSaveAlFileAction`: Automatically will Rename/Reorganize the file you are editing.  Takes into account the prefix/suffix as well.
