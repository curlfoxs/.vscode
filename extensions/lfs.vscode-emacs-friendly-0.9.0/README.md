# vscode-emacs-friendly

This plugin provides emacs keybindings and workflow for Visual Studio Code and is a fork of the great vscode extension by [hiro-sun](https://github.com/hiro-sun/vscode-emacs).

It merges some of the pull requests in the original and other external helpers that make the extension a little less an exact copy of emacs behavior, and a little more friendly in interacting with the system clipboard and normal vscode interactions.

The following are some of the changes and enhancements from the original:

* The clipboard handling is simplified by the removal of the emacs-only kill ring (which was also an unfinished implementation in the original). Copy, Cut, Yank and C-K work with the system clipboard now.
* C+x k to close tab, C+x C-k all tabs
* C+l centers screen on the cursor line
* C+x C+f bound to quick open file
* yank overwrites selection
