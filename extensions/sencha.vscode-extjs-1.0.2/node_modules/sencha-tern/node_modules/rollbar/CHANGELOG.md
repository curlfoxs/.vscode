# Change Log

**0.5.8**
- Fix bug that caused some frames to not report context lines. See [#52](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/52)

**0.5.7**
- Fix bug fetching request protocol. See [#56](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/56)

**0.5.6**
- Describe the original error a bit better when `handleErrorWithPayloadData()` couldn't recognize the err type.

**0.5.5**
- Bugfix: Fix `handleError()` to work with Strings.

**0.5.4**
- Bugfix: Cast `error.message` to `String`. Test objects as Error arguments.

**0.5.3**
- Fix bug that was causing an infinite loop while building the payload for request objects.

**0.5.2**
- Collect `process.argv` and `process.pid` as part of the 'server' metadata

**0.5.1**
- Fixed a bug that occurred if `exitOnUncaught` was set to true and an unhandled exception occurred, ([#38](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/issues/38))

**0.5.0**
- Refactored most of the notifier code to use the async library.
  - Fixed myriad JSLint warnings/errors. 
- Fixed various bugs related to the different `handler` options.
- Added `X-Rollbar-Access-Token` header for faster responses from the server.
- Fix bug where the app could shut down before all data was sent to Rollbar and/or the callbacks called, ([#34](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/issues/34))

### Backwards incompatible changes

- Removed `handler`, `handlerInterval` options
  - There is only a single handler type now which will send the error/message
    as soon as it can. The communication is all done via asynchronous calls and will
    not block IO.
- Removed `batchSize` option
  - The notifier no longer batches together data before sending it. This was error prone and could lead to loss of
    errors if there was a problem reporting any in the batch.
- Removed rollbar.shutdown()
  - Now that there are no longer any `setInterval()` calls, there is no need to wait for anything from the Rollbar
    library in order to shutdown cleanly.
    

**0.4.5**
- Fix a bug that was causing the notifier to not catch all uncaught exceptions. ([#36](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/36))

**0.4.4**
- Fix a bug when `req.socket` was undefined. ([#33](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/33))

**0.4.3**
- Support HTTP proxies. ([#32](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/32))

**0.4.2**
- Fixed a bug that caused the library to crash if a request was provided but did not have a `headers` object. ([#31](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/31))

**0.4.1**
- Fixed a bug that caused the library to crash if a request was provided but did not have a `connection` object.
- Added some error logging to the `uncaughtException` handler to output uncaught exceptions to the log and to log if there were any problems handling the uncaught exception.

**0.4.0**
- Set the default handler to be `inline` so that if the program crashes since some configurations will shut down before the `setInterval()` is fired.
  - To maintain v0.3 behavior, simply add `handler: 'setInterval'` to the config object passed to `rollbar.init()`.

**0.3.13**
- Allow environment and framework to be overridden by payload data.

- Fix param scrubbing failing when the value is null/undefined ([#30](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/30))

**0.3.11**
- Add `handleErrorWithPayloadData` function, exposing more of the Rollbar API when reporting errors. ([#29](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/29))

**0.3.10**
- Fix edge case where multiple errors were not handled correctly. ([#28](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/issues/28))

**0.3.9**
- Add `verbose` configuration option, `true` by default.

**0.3.6**
- Allow addRequestData to be overridden. ([#24](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/24))

**0.3.5**
- Handles a situation where circular references could likely exist which may result in no payload being sent at all.

**0.3.4**
- Fix bug that was not properly serializing JSON when there were multiple references to the same object in the payload.

**0.3.3**
- Fix bug that caused error reports to be swallowed when the stacktrace contains files that cannot be read ([#22](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/22))
- Parse CoffeeScript stack traces ([#23](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar/pull/23))

**0.3.2**
